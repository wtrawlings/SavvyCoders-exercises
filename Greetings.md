  I'm an aspiring Web Developer. I'm in the industry so I know this time I will get the time to get better than the basics learned within the limited time of classes.


  I will keep working on tutorials to show passion and sharpen skill.

  - html
  - css
  - javascript
  - jQwery
  - Node.JS

  That will be phase one!
  - Java
  - Python

  This will be the true goal. I will have transcended from Web Developer to Programmer and perhaps UI
